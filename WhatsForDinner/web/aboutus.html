            The idea for Whats For Dinner? came about when our founder was still a young naive Computer Science Student and found 
            himself in a sticky situation: Later that night he had a 2nd date with a girl coming over for dinner that he really wanted to impress.  Being a typical nerd with little cooking skills (typically living off of Taco Bell)he had no idea what he could cook with what 
            was in his pantry.  He ended up throwing together some spaghetti and frozen meatballs but thought to himself that he had an idea.  What if you could enter what you had on hand and a database would return a list of recipes of what you could cook with them?
            
            
            Several years later our founder has a growing company and partnerships with several high profile chefs and is now helping tens of thousands of people across the country decide "Whats for Dinner?".
